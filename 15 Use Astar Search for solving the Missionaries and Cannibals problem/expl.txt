Explanation:

The initial state is defined as (3, 3, 1), which means that there are three missionaries and three cannibals on the left side of the river, and the boat is on the left side.
The goal state is defined as (0, 0, 0), which means that all the people and the boat are on the right side of the river.
The heuristic function is defined as the sum of the number of missionaries and cannibals on the left side of the river, which is admissible because it underestimates the number of steps required to reach the goal.
The cost function is defined as a constant value of 1, which means that each step has the same cost.
The function to get the next states is defined based on the constraints of the problem. If the boat is on the left side, it generates all possible combinations of one or two missionaries and cannibals that can cross the river without violating the constraints. If the boat is on the right side, it generates all possible combinations of one or two people that can cross the river back to the left side.
The A* search algorithm is implemented using a priority queue. The initial state is added to the queue with a priority of 0. The explored set is initialized as an empty set. A dictionary is used to keep track of the state that led to each explored state.
The algorithm iterates until the priority queue is empty or the goal state is found. In each iteration, it retrieves the state with the lowest priority from the queue and checks if it is the goal state. If it is, it reconstructs the path from the initial state to the goal state using the dictionary and returns it. If it is not, it adds the state to the explored set and generates the next possible states. For each next state, it calculates the cost to reach it from the current state and the estimated cost to reach the goal state from it using the cost and heuristic functions, respectively. If the next state has not been explored yet, it adds it to the priority queue with the calculated priority and records the current state as the state that led to it in the dictionary.
